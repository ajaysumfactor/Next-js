## React Hookss

### useState Hooks
    step:---
    1. import { useState } from "react";
    2. useState accepts an initial state and returns two values:
        1. The current state.
        2. Afunction that update the state.
        3. To update the state, we can call the function returned by useState.
        4. 

### useEffect Hooks
   #### [useEffect Hooks](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_useeffectasp#:~:text=The%20useEffect%20Hook%20allows%20you,function%3E%2C%20)

    1. useEffect Hook allows us to perform side effects in my components.
    2. example:-fetching data.
    3. It accepts two arguments ,second argument is optional.
        useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)

        In my project useEffect Hook is dependent on (latLong) minute i click on the view store nearby button it will fetch the current location of user and (latLong has now some different value ) so our function will run and render data on UI.

### NEXT_PUBLIC_--PREFIX
    By default all environment variables loaded through (.env.local) ,And that is only available in the node.js environment ,To access token on client side i use NEXT_PUBLIC_ Prefix in variable name in env.local file.

    In my project i used = (useEffect hoook ) --perform side effect(fetching data).And react component is rendered on client side .
